# Use Cases for Voice Recognition App

This document outlines the specific use cases for our voice recognition application. These use cases will guide the development of key features and functionalities.

## Use Case 1: Voice Command Recognition

**Description:** The user speaks a command to the application, and the application recognizes and executes the command.

**Actors:** User, Voice Recognition System

**Flow:**
1. The user speaks a command to the application.
2. The application captures the audio input.
3. The voice recognition system processes the audio input and converts it into text.
4. The application interprets the command and executes the corresponding action.

## Use Case 2: Voice-to-Text Transcription

**Description:** The user speaks to the application, and the application transcribes the speech into text.

**Actors:** User, Voice Recognition System

**Flow:**
1. The user speaks to the application.
2. The application captures the audio input.
3. The voice recognition system processes the audio input and converts it into text.
4. The application displays the transcribed text to the user.

## Use Case 3: Interactive Voice Response

**Description:** The user asks a question or makes a request, and the application responds verbally.

**Actors:** User, Voice Recognition System, Response Handling System

**Flow:**
1. The user asks a question or makes a request to the application.
2. The application captures the audio input.
3. The voice recognition system processes the audio input and converts it into text.
4. The response handling system generates a response based on the user's input.
5. The application delivers the response to the user verbally.

These use cases represent the core functionalities of our voice recognition application. As the project progresses, we may identify additional use cases to further enhance the user experience.
