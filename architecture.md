# Application Architecture for Voice Recognition App

This document outlines the architecture of our voice recognition application. The architecture is designed based on the key features, use cases, and libraries defined in the project.

## Component 1: Audio Capture

**Description:** This component is responsible for capturing the user's voice as audio input.

**Details:** This component is based on the `node-record-lpcm16` library. It will record the user's voice in LPCM format, which is compatible with the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text library. The corresponding file in the project is `audio_capture.js`.

## Component 2: Voice Recognition

**Description:** This component is responsible for processing the audio input and converting it into text.

**Details:** This component is based on the `Google Cloud Speech-to-Text` library. It will process the audio input captured by the Audio Capture component and convert it into text. The corresponding file in the project is `voice_recognition.js`.

## Component 3: Response Handling

**Description:** This component is responsible for generating responses based on the user's input.

**Details:** This component is based on the `Microsoft Azure Text to Speech` library. It will generate a verbal response based on the text input, which is the result of the user's voice processed by the Voice Recognition component. The corresponding file in the project is `response_handling.js`.

## Component 4: User Interface

**Description:** This component is responsible for interacting with the user.

**Details:** This component will display the transcribed text to the user and deliver the verbal responses generated by the Response Handling component. The corresponding file in the project is `ui.js`.

## Application Workflow

1. The user interacts with the User Interface component, either by speaking a command, speaking for transcription, or asking a question.
2. The Audio Capture component records the user's voice and sends the audio input to the Voice Recognition component.
3. The Voice Recognition component processes the audio input and converts it into text.
4. Depending on the user's interaction, the text is either displayed to the user by the User Interface component (for transcription), interpreted and executed as a command (for voice command recognition), or used as input for the Response Handling component (for interactive voice response).
5. If the text is used as input for the Response Handling component, a response is generated and delivered to the user verbally through the User Interface component.

This architecture represents the core structure of our voice recognition application. As the project progresses, we may refine this architecture to further enhance the user experience.
